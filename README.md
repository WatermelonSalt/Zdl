# Zdl

Zdl is a TUI(Textual User Interface) for the famous books download site Z-Library!

This application is in any way not connected with that site or their maintainers, this is just an application to search the books they offer from a terminal

## What it can do

Zdl, at the moment, can do the following things

* Search for books from Z-Library
* Display all of the search results returned in a clean way
* Redirect the selected book to download to your browser

## What it can't do

Zdl can't do the following things, for now

* Zdl can only redirect to the browser for downloads at the moment because of their protection of the content from direct access, if you know how to bypass that please do contribute to this project
* Zdl cannot bypass the download limit imposed by the site itself

## How do I use it?

Zdl can be used by executing `zdl.py` as it is
This will most likely be a pip installable package in the future updates

### What are the controls?

* `Ctrl + b` is used to toggle the search box
* The `Enter` key is used when the search box is active to search for the book
* `j` and `k` are used to navigate the body after the search
* `h` and `l` are used to navigate the footer after the search
* `Ctrl + h` is used to load the currently active page highlighted in the footer
* `Ctrl + m` is used to quickly load the initial page
* The `Tab` key is used to look up and download the currently selected book in the browser
